# quasi_xper

`quasi_xper` is a Python package designed for quasi-experimental analysis, particularly focusing on difference-in-differences (DID) and synthetic control methods. This package provides tools for data preparation, visualization, and statistical modeling to estimate treatment effects in panel data.

## Features

- **Time Series Plotting**: Visualize time series data for multiple units.
- **Fixed Effects Regression**: Prepare data and fit fixed effects models using statsmodels.
- **Synthetic Control Method**: Create synthetic control units and estimate treatment effects.
- **Power Analysis**: Simulate power for DID estimates.
- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**: Generate synthetic datasets for unit testing.

## Usage
